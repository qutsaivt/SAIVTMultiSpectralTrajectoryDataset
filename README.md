# SAIVT Multi-Spectral Trajectory Dataset

This dataset consists of trajectories captured simultaenously from two data sources:
1. A CCTV camera
2. A Radar

Raw CCTV footage along with extracted trajectories for the two modes are provided at https://data.researchdatafinder.qut.edu.au/dataset/saivt-multi-spectral-trajectory-dataset.

Raw radar data is available on request, however you will need the Cambridge Pixel SDK to read this data. Trajectories from the radar feed have been extracted using the tracker within the SDK.
